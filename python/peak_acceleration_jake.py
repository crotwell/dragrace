#  time series by factor to convert into g's (4069 = 1g?), returns the g's
# magnitude over a small amount of time (depends on len of arrays given),
# and sends this mag to ring server

# need: what is rest state? (calculate mean of before and after filter) (have a
# 'z-corrected factor', and rn it is 1)
# look at MMA file... look at line 249
